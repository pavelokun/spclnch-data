      "description": "\"On the scale of the nano-world, each of us is a universe that consists of perturbations of the wavy environment. Its elements structurally repeat each other up to a certain limit, until a change in values gives rise to a new property ...\" — Spacelunch was enthusiastically introducing the scientific pop to his partner, who was a reputed lover of philosophical references to physics. Although such stories tended to reproduce themselves, this was an exceptional case — the entrance hall of the Biomolecular Institute of Venus served as a classroom, where many outstanding minds were schooled after the explosion of the Large Hadron Collider.\n\nClimbing the enlarged DNA model as a library ladder, the professor thought about standards of different orders and the launch of an electromagnetic installation that allows reducing the size of objects by billions of times. With the installation of an artery in the background, Cat jumped from one erythrocyte to another, concentrating before each next manoeuvre. On the eve of crucial but dangerous tests, all interactions looked as relaxed as possible, but it was necessary to take all the risks into account.",

      "description": "Alternative uploading of scripts into the cerebral cortex has long been serving as a protection against the disastrous consequences of neurodegeneration. The sessions involve the introduction of updated software directly through the patient's energy field. During the Third Constellation War, the Smorings got the unspoken biohacking technologies from local looters who offered everything that came to hand.\n\n— ...After all, I was a leading researcher of the observatory, and they treated me like this! Outrageous!\n— Try to distract yourself, I need to connect to your nervous system. May the force of the elements be with us.\n\nThe Queen closed her eyes and gradually fell into a trance. A languid voice began to pronounce incantations in a strange language, to the beat of which Cat was snoring absently. The phrases resonated and stuck together. Healing psionic currents slid over Spacelunch's head, creating colored hyperspace kaleidoscopes in the darkness of his closed eyes.\n\n\"Hmm, the Voynich manuscript? The old man Bacon would be delighted right now...\", — out-of-body experiences gradually subsided under dark glasses. A ringing silence hung around, which meant a complete shutdown of internal navigation. Failure to reinstall is fraught not only with disorientation, but also with the erasure of all skills. A few seconds remained to prevent the complete disintegration of the personality…",

      "description": "Episodes of sacred rites held near the bygone Indian reservation were emerging in Spacelunch's memory. According to the legend of the Sumerians, the sacred altar at the foot of the mountain of monuments hid the secrets of thousands of customs. Is it a lot or not? It is impossible to predict how the story could have continued if it had not been for the ritual with the potion made of the Ayahuasca.\n\nThe ceremony of reunion with the spirits of nature allowed barely noticeable sprouts to grow inside the consciousness — harbingers of a huge storm that knocks down and mercilessly shatters the mind like an empty bottle against stones. Defenceless humility and love in response to the laughter of the universe is the only chance to feel freedom, be alone with yourself and warm your neighbours with the inner fire.",

      "description": "The sabotage in the dungeons of a secluded flying prison is what really excites the mind. The deserters who committed a crime against the sound routine were detained here. A complex string of security cameras and fingerprint sensors left no choice. The access to the data library, which had been violently confiscated from prisoners, was only possible through a small window at the top of the dome.\n\n \"Well, just a little bit more...\", slightly biting his tongue to restrain the desire to rip the transparent armour open, Spacelunch filigreed his part of the work with a high-precision glass-cutter laser and a pair of suction cups. Drops of sweat traitorously rolled down his face, urging him to make it before the unintentional triggering of the security alarm.\n\nThe creaking of the bare cable on which Cat was descending was interrupted by loud thoughts about spys' failures and doubtless courage. The complex analysis of incoming information had a vulnerability – it reacted only to the smooth skin, so it turned out to be completely powerless in front of the agile, furry paws. Who knows what else will be found among the myriad of shelves, intriguing with their secrets…",

      "description": "Instantly, everything was covered with a veil of toxic fog. Suffocating fumes rolled into the respirators in dense corrosive clouds, which made it difficult for Cat to make out the readings of the holographic gas analyzer. The surface of the Mesozoic planet has an aggressive chemical composition, so finding a radioisotope generator stuck here is not an easy task.\n\nFortunately, a twilight pterosarius with an unusual structure of the respiratory system, who was tamed by Spacelunch in one of his travels, appeared out of nowhere. Its massive, webbed wings serve as the walls of a vacuum capsule, and its lungs, like a filter, create an atmosphere familiar to humans. The help turned out to be very useful. It's time to focus on the clicks of the dosimeter and detect the power source.",

      "description": "Bogged down in a pile of archival documents and adstracts from alchemical synopses, Spacelunch fell asleep unnoticed. Concentrated reading dragged him into the world of dreams which, as usual, was at his favorite desk. However, someone didn't want to stop there.\n\nNaively inspired by the legend of homunculi, Cat decided to personally assess the activity of neurotransmitters in the ionized gas environment. The old experiments of their parasientific cooperation on the influence of information fields on the cerebral hemispheres were considered incomplete. Isn't this a reason for new experiments on the mental platform? As soon as the trial sample was subjected to intense exposure of the plasmaballs, tightly clamped in restless paws, there was a resounding click.\n\nBy chance, the professor's dream turned out to be less sensitive than it might seem at first glance. Jumping up after a piercing \"meow\", he felt the sharp smell of electrified wool: \"Hey, buddy, are you okay?! Please be careful with the Tesla radiation!\"",

      "description": "The painstaking preparation for the photon march took place in advance in chamber conditions. The seriousness of intentions was confirmed by loads of flasks, test tubes and neatly arranged reagents which require extreme concentration. The deductive-analytical board displayed a sequential chain of important events and complex chemical equations. The slightest oversight could lead to the disintegration of unstable elements.\n\nCat couldn't take his eyes out of the honed movements of the Spacelunch. In the minds of both flashed a whirlpool of thoughts, ranging from genetic engineering and varieties of crystal lattices, down to doubts and a desire to have a delicious dinner. A sleepless night in the mobile laboratory was supposed to bear fruit. However, to steal important data marked \"secret\", it will take much more time and effort than expected.",

The signs, shimmering with multicolored diodes, rattled in unison with the rhythm of the dancefloor. The vibration seeped out from behind the doors and was noticeably felt in the chest area. The entrance to the club was securely guarded.\n\n– Do you see this huge caterpillar? As soon as he turns away, I'll give the signal. Stay tuned.\n– Yeah, they only serve in special detachments. On Alien-TV, they said that their hearing was not very good — Cat was in slight confusion and tried to calm himself with reasoning.\n– We are waiting, a little more… Go ahead!\n\nThe surprise effect failed immediately after the astonished face of security appeared in the sights. Everyone froze, looking at each other in confusion.\n\n– Hey, where are you going?\n– Melvin...?! My friend, I can't believe my eyes!!! Who would have thought...\n– You know. After leaving the Aerospace Corporation, I'm wary of harassment. And you, I see, obviously have not come to dance.\n– Hats off, you're a master of conspiracy, but... We have almost fried you!\n\nMelvin remained silent for a long time. The moment has come to reveal a lot of unexpected details.",

Don't jump to conclusions — I think that everything happened for a reason.\n\nThe streets of Chinatown attracted by the smells of exotic cuisine, what cannot be said about the sudden appearance of the detectives. Anyone who even occasionally felt the inquisitive eyes on them shied away from them. Sellers of all sorts of things were fussily whispering and continuously watching every step of the uninvited guests. The whole block seemed to know about the ongoing investigation. Looking around intently, the professor suddenly came across the strange but very familiar tracks.\n\n\"It can't be... the credentials and password turned out to be fake! Cat, follow me!\" – Spacelunch made a note in his diary and walked rapidly along the stalls. He knew that the truth was somewhere nearby.",

      "description": "- What the hell is this...?!\n- I... I don't know... Do you see it too?\n- Believe it or not, I do see it! Well, get ready, you vile overgrown clam!!!\n- Cat, remove the splitter, the gun won't help anymore...\n\nThe echoes of the past in the blink of an eye turned the feeling of slight confusion into a complete stupor. Gripped by the horror of the memories, the space stalkers froze in front of a black mass with nasty, slimy hanging tentacles. The growing confusion was completely ingrained in their minds and was becoming more pronounced by the minute.\n\nSticky tar-like drops were falling loudly from the ceiling. It was as if someone had turned off the light and shuffled the measurement deck overnight. The despair reached its climax when hundreds of blade-sharp suckers hung down at arm's length. Death agony or last chance?\n\n- Hey... Do you hear me? We need an antidote! - Spacelunch moved abruptly.\n- It was an honor for me to fight side by side with such an amazing partner...\n- Damn it, I'll try to free my hands.\n\nSometimes desperate adventures tend to come to an end. Apparently, one of them is closer to the completion than ever...",

      "description": "The path to the sacred altar at the foot of the mountain of Monuments wound through the ruins of the Dead City that resembled an ancient Phoenician settlement. There was only one thing that was alarming here — strong landscape distortions. The web of streets and blocks weaved endless patterns, rounding the corners and drawing strange, sometimes impossible geometry. Dilapidated palace towers with mysterious frescoes and time-worn colonnades reminded of a once prosperous state. The smell of decay and the cold shade of the fortress walls reminded of the times of padishahs and sultans who greedily fought for the throne.\n\n- What are you thinking about all the time?! - Spacelunch exclaimed nervously, anticipating the answer in advance.\n- Well, do you remember the last time something like this happened and...\nThe professor cut him off in disgust:\n- Come on, it's all over with him!\n- To find a way out, we must activate mechanisms that change the route, - Cat immediately noticed.\n- But this is possible only with the help of the hectopod – the totem of optical illusions, you know?",

The tides of the Green Moon cause the strongest hallucinations when influencing the hypotolamus.\"\n\nThe music led the inexorable hunters with an invisible hand, balancing in each the beginning and the end, the twilight of the shadow side of the moon and the energy of solar flares — Yin and Yang. The poisonous formaldehyde cloud began to dissipate. Cat cast a confused glance at the body, which was no longer the same, but still obeyed him...\n\n\"Damn it, we succeeded! Superpower has been studied!\" SpaceCat exclaimed enthusiastically. The mission revolved around a simple truth: to see one part of yourself, you need to see the other, which means that only harmony and balance open up new trajectories in the knowledge of space.",

After taking the right dosage, he habitually looked at his partner and, barely uttering a word, felt a soft isoteric glow.\n\n– The chosen path is not accidental, my friend.\n– Cat?

A surge of energy forced his body to move to the rhythm of the sound-pumping speakers. \"Mechatronics!\" said Spacelunch with a grin. He had guessed the existence of such engineering solutions. At the right moment, the once-tamed element helped launch the plasma engines. It was enough to rely on hearing.",

      "description": "Aloha!\nMike Schommer's musical expression formed the basis of the plot of his new record. A deliciously unsettling ode to the '90s subculture in Port Huron (Michigan), demonstrates the eccentricity and inspirational influence exerted on the American master over the past few decades.\nThe author's counterform subverts the orthodox approach and genre claims. Fitting in the right proportions in a cognitive audio performance, remixes accompany fairy-tale originals and develop mediated audio discourse. The colorful music library is complemented by the diligent, overflowing radiance of the southern chronicler Artur Galstyan aka Heavenchord, the traditionally fresh, exciting delights of Peter Fanai and the ornate frescoes of the Echoton brothers.\nThe multi-part exhibition invites you to the publishing house \"spclnch\". Welcome to the world of sincere thoughts, monumentalism and borderline stylizations with a share of curiosities!",

      "description": "After bypassing the security system and gaining access to the classified archives of the aerospace corporation, Spacelunch discovered something important – the protocols of closed photon tests. The atavistic horror he had experienced in the depths of the infernal dimension only encouraged him to master psychotronic cryokinesis.\n\nIt was necessary to derive the formula for the collapse of the dark galactic stratum as soon as possible. This process will lead to a powerful flash and the release of energy of the giant cooling rings, which will put an end to the chilling experiments on consciousness.",

The previous research team left behind only SOS signals, frightening with their helplessness and encrypted on the flight recorder as a warning to all outsiders about the inadmissibility of staying here.\n\nThe audio messages contain information about strange pataphysical phenomena, suspicious accidents, and a mass obsession of the expedition members. Rare specimens of the fauna of the infernal dimension, collected at the cost of many human lives, pointed to the main mystery – a sarcophagus with ancient writings sealed with an occult pentagram. The die is cast, what remains is being patient and count on luck.",

An astrophysical textbook with the basics of meta-cognitive therapy is of a great help in planning new searches in the depths of the celestial web, reboot and dream circulation.\n\nCat performs a ritual of debugging vibration fields with the help of immersive mantras. Their light, airy reflections have long been used to eliminate nonverbal attacks on consciousness. The multidimensional immersion in the cradle of sound sensorics becomes tangible.",

The encounter with the minimal antagonist, who was following the irreconcilable ufologists during the quantum leap, was so unexpected that they barely realized how they switched bodies.\n\nThe endless maze of stairs and abandoned, winding corridors of the aerospace corporation was confusing due to spatial reversion. The cuttlefish's minions, the shadow phantoms, followed them step by step like its ubiquitous giant tentacles, crawling underfoot and along the walls.\n\nCat 007 fastidiously refused to put up with the role of prisoners and, grabbing his friend, blasting well-aimed, cutting shots from the service blaster, left a couple of decent holes in the energy field of annoying creatures. Without a doubt, it became obvious that interplanetary explorers were being hunted.",

Drama and the eager grin of adventure have slowed down, bowing its heads in submission to the convergence of musical exuberance. Meditation on the event horizon lit the torch of sharpened perception of all the amplitude shifts.\n\nDubby substrate absorbed every scrap of the all-pervading ether. This meant that the indefatigable pioneers had harnessed the elements, becoming the bearers of important, extracted knowledge. From now on, their bioresonators are as precisely tuned as possible to the condensation of acoustic waves, which, like a compass, will point the way to the probabilities that emit a powerful impulse. Space stalking and audio transcription are being taken to the new dimensions.",

      "description": "Having won approval and success in its debut release, the spclnch vinyl series continues with the release of a second record from Wiesbaden producer – Peter Fanai.\nWeighty, spacious bass pleiades fill the sound field, erase the consequences of duality and, flowing into the viscous full-bodied substance of verified sound design, it would seem that they will momentarily shift the tectonic plates of the electronic genre.\nMaestro Basicnoise is again involved in the spatial enrichment of textural proportions of reverberation and percussion. This time, their sequence runs under the quality mark of the Australian-German collaboration. The accurate Kooscha warms up the sensorics with elegant dance manipulations and a distinct rhythm, and the related association Echoton traditionally introduces a tart concentrate of meaningful thoughts.\nThe rich aftertaste of variable electronic abstractions takes the subconscious and musical outlook to a different plane.\nNow you are more than an observer.",

      "description": "A beam of intense light drew the professor's attention to the hypno-spiral, which had become his first goal in studying astronomical objects of the \"Quasar\" class. However, everyone has their own desires. Cat, for example, tried to comprehend passionarity and look at the reflection of what was happening. The genre scenes that unfolded before the eyes of the experimenters went beyond the 3d dimension. Bubble pattern, cold draft, rusted house, wet format – they seemed to be on the verge of insanity.\n\nAlthough in the past the Spacelunch studied at the Department of Experimental Phonetics and Speech Synthesis, the adaptation of consciousness was still difficult. The answers to the inner questions turned into a swarm of sound isotopes. Space was shifting, going deep, rotating and stretching in all possible directions, reducing all efforts to concentrate almost to zero. No wonder, because music is not just a technical object, but an ideological principle. The delta dimension, which is full of spectral lines, is clearly not the place for a logical routine with complex calculations - the auditory stream expresses something more, just trust the sensations.",

Electromagnetic induction and differential change of the phase integral are calculated! Full speed ahead!\"\n\nAfter passing through the dense asteroid belt, the broken testers found that a kinetic teleport spat out their aircraft near the orbital station \"Research Institute of Cybernetics\", where an unscheduled study of the dynamic modulations and illumination of the moon was carried out using ultrasonic transducers.\n\nWith amazing ease, they ended up in the center of scientific research, in the middle of a landfill filled with splitting blasters and life-size holographic models. The mechanics of this action had an absolutely mesmerizing effect, making anyone who witnessed it freeze in amazement. The slow-motion fashion show of the prototypes reflected the metamorphoses of the growing (as they say among Earthlings), full and waning moon, reminding us of the grandiosity of the internal changes of each of us and of the magnetic integrity they possess.",

But what will they become: a collection of fears and questions or the embodiment of a real experience? The cabin shook, the sensors screeched in unison, announcing extreme overload, a bright flash! Emptiness. What is it: strange whispers, snatches of sounds, noises, echoes of the frightening unknown rang in my ears.\n\nIt soon turned out that riding the waves of atomic-molecular flow is not so scary. Quantum teleportation is quite a common process for those who have fallen into the cold embrace of a black hole. Random formulas, geometric progressions, and a detailed model of the universe pop up in your mind as if at someone's command. Suddenly, a strange silhouette flashed past - perhaps a clot of dark matter, or perhaps someone got caught in an endless cycle and rushed with great speed into a parallel dimension. The main thing is not to break into particles from such a swirl and strong rotation.\n\nThe intergalactic tornado calmed down and the image stabilized. Just think, until recently Cat could not imagine such a story. His eyes widened in surprise. Looking at each other, the friends realized that everything had happened for a reason, they were being watched...",

      "description": "The alien scenario was unfolding very dynamically, so the daring pilgrims decided to look into one quaint place where you can hide from the universal bustle, take a breath and enjoy the spatial modeling. By the way, it helps to recover after critical overloads through fine motor skills.\n\nWelcome to the heavenly body \"Orlan 19\". Once it was assigned an ordinal number, and it got this name because of its ultra-low gravity. Obviously, this \"dwarf\" became an attraction and just a recreational area for many nomads. Its atmosphere is literally packed with thoughtfully hovering objects of various configurations. A kind of metaphysical equilibrium. Here it is customary to not only enjoy the abundance of entertainment, but also the thoughts about where the consciousness leads us in search of its home.\n\nDeftly juggling patterns, the technologist grabbed an experimental sample labeled RTW1350, which, thanks to its composition and consistency, easily gives the appearance of a basketball.\nCatch - the next throw is yours!",

      "description": "Due to the impact, the spaceship's landing struts dug into the hard surface, forming a dense dust cloud around them. They departed too far from their intended trajectory and made a forced hard landing. A critical dose of meteor fragments damaged one of the engines. It was necessary to fix the damage as soon as possible or to get an alternative type of fuel.\n\nAfter looking around them, the space travelers began to move towards the mysterious craters almost by feel. Suddenly, the ground got out from under their feet. Due to poor visibility, the rush led to an expectable outcome. \"Great, we're trapped!\", - Cat looked at his companion from under his brows, insistently hinting at a clear explanation of what was happening.\n\n– This is a Planet of Mineralization's Dubs, my friend.\n– Hm...\n– Its interior consists of metamorphic deposits formed by layers of two types of fossils: igneous and sedimentary.\n– Mineralization's Dubs?!\n– I don't know, what's bothering you?\n– At least the fact that we are waist-deep in a swamp with an incomprehensible viscous substance!\n– We'll get out, don't doubt it. There are still many mysteries to solve in the Universe. Just focus on these sound waves, can you hear them?",

It's time to start exploring the sky and the blurry, bright streaks of constellations passing by.\n\nCat’s partner's habit of putting his feet up on the spaceship's dashboard has sometimes disturbed him, but it hasn't stopped him from briskly sorting through the options in their traditional “Last Letter” game, where words denoted instances of sound, time, and space, rather than the usual Earth cities.\n\nA long journey is coming and it is unknown which form of matter will be encountered this time.",

The flow of sound, though not always obvious, manipulations creates a sense of dynamic balance.\nThe incomprehensibly abstract environment, saturated with biology and meaning of digital structures, finds its culmination in a Remix from the master of uncompromising grooves — Basicnoise! His boundless space Odysseys are echoed by a deep bass that abolishes ephemeral musical constructions.",

      "description": "When it comes to a starship, it often seems to be something huge. However, once it comes closer to the Saturn, giant size of the interstellar vehicle turns to atomic particles. Great shadow of the planet envelops spaceship making it transparent in total darkness, like immersing it to the chambers of depression, so cold and distant.\nThe mind falls down to infinity when faced with thousand years objects. Probably, living beings will never understand what does it feel like a hundred million years long life travelling through endless empty space.",

Its particles are in motion for millions of years conceiving nebulas, star systems and galaxies which are eventually going to return to their initial state.\nEverything around is weaved from the same star matter, first creating and then destroying. And everything cycles and repeats again and again.\nThis is the inevitability, the law of existence.\nWe only get to observe.",

There is nothing better than feeling that the most important people are here, right next to you. At this touching moment there happens divine miracle - Love.\nHave things really changed since then? Maybe.\nHowever something has remained unchanged and comes to visit us occasionally - it's a belief in goodness, something that we have from the very beginning.\nThis is our little secret out of time.\nThe main thing - to trust in that.",

Later, even not the most pleasant memories somehow are wrapped in serene foil forming the integrated whole in the lifestream.",

      "description": "Three dub Musketeers, nobly animating the ubiquitous flow of reverberations, skillfully fence with micro-textures. Desolated melancholy and dotted rhythm emphasize the formlessness of ambient structures, causing emotional restraint.\nThe limited edition record by Vincent Raude (Upwellings), a French cultivator of deep-sea dub techno streams, comes from the bowels of analog synthesizers. Its sound makes sense and steadily penetrates into the auditory range, expressing the interactive-spatial evolution of music.\nPeter Fanai (Basicnoise), a lover of subtle dubby jams, producing from late 90s and consistent, methodical electronic pedant from Sydney Kyryl Polozyuk (Kooscha) made a vinyl contribution.\n\n«Once you have chosen your path, you will become it. The once perplexing vicissitudes of fate will be taken as a starting point. We are here and continue to see incredible in the usual!»",

Concentration is more important now than ever before, otherwise there is a risk of falling and dissolving into infinite space. But what is it around? Space? Another dimension? Or maybe it's a tunnel full of your fears and memories?\nYeah, we all have something to hide, and you're not an exception. You can run as fast as you can, at light speed, but remember, you can't run away from yourself.\nIt's all about what's between the lines of yourself.\nIt seems like you're stuck here in the middle of your fear cosmos forever. And you know what? It's the truth. Your thoughts will find you. Wherever you're hiding, wherever you're trying to go.\nThose distant stars, that frightening darkness... That's all is you.\nNow you understand: there is only one way - to move forward.",

These worlds have no clearly defined framework, and one hardly can exist without the other one. Only plunging into the outside world, only hiding in the unknown space, you can extend the territory of your own megapolis.\nReturning to your domain, take a look around, because the avenue of your consciousness has already expanded.",

      "description": "Wait stranger, take a look around.\nHave you ever noticed how many things are happening around, that everything has its own rhythm, its sense of time and space. And all about that is interconnected. Time... It's what points the way, making you different from whom you were a moment ago. It is worth remembering, it flows in only one direction, and therefore causes such a strong interest.\nLet the rhythm of time pass through you and give it free rein. And then it becomes clear that the present moment is something elusive. This is the moment when emotions, events and space merge together, when you catch yourself of thinking that the moment you are living is eternal. But only here and only now.\nIf you could choose which moment to pause and make it last forever, which one it would be?\n\nIn the compilation, the theme of time was used as a foundation. Each participant revealed it in its own way, original and unique. Each of them knows exactly how to stop time and grasp the moment of eternity. Pleasant journey.\n\nContinuation can be found on hello▼strange:\nhellostrange.bandcamp.com/album/time",

Carefully, leisurely, calmly and harmoniously, sometimes hypnotizing, the author moves us from composition to composition, then picking up the pace, then slowing down, leaving a pleasant aftertaste. Enjoy listening!",

In my heart was unbearable pleasant pain, which was amplified from a favorite melody or just smile. I couldn't think about anything. I felt like I was seeing the world for the first time.\"\n\nThis live was recorded by Vincent Raude at the Dimensions festival in Croatia in 2018. Depth, space, dynamics, stunning dialogue and interaction of musical parties, minimalism.\nBy the way, on october 17 on spclnch will be released an EP from Upwellings under the title «Illusory Fog». The release will be available digitally as well as on limited edition vinyl (pre-order on Bandcamp: bit.ly/2ANDLGk).",

The mysterious anatomy of arrangements is built by the harmony of electroacoustic abstractions. The stylistic richness hides eternal, defining meanings, woven from categorical percussion, pad mysticism, and tapping, chirping and rustling arising out of nowhere. The truth of destiny lies in diligent efforts and in the power of ennobling work. Dedication to the craft, despite the taste of disappointment, opens a way to self-acceptance.",

The awakening power of love completely embraces fragile beauty, displacing man-made interventions.\n\nThe natural principle is embodied in the unity of life forms. Like water, the soft combination of piano and synthesizer textures finds its way into the hearts. Despite the cloudy indifference and inexplicable longing, the healing notes don’t leave anyone unimpressed.",

The key ethical principles are an individual approach and a careful selection which allows you to get the best possible from the communication with artists. \n\nThe concept of releases is dedicated to a fantastic multimedia universe. The space adventures of Spacelunch and Cat unfold in episodes of an interactive musical comic. Each of them has an original script, and they are connected by a consistent storyline."

An adventurer with a quick mind and lightning-fast analytics; a gambler and a sore loser who has a constant thirst for discoveries, which is why he and his partener often get into trouble. He doesn't remember the last time he was on his home planet or if he has ever been there at all. He travels on an aircraft with a warp engine.\n\nCat is Spacelunch's once-beloved pet, accidentally endowed with human intelligence and the ability to speak in one of his experiments. In critical situations, he is skeptical, grumpy, but shows ingenuity and courage. Has a great command of a service blaster.\n\nMinimal-antagonist is a fiend of hopeless darkness in the guise of a giant cuttlefish. The envious, unscrupulous and cruel creator of the aerospace corporation. He is able to summon shadow phantoms, to connect to someone else's consciousness and to control it. The phenomenal regeneration allows him to remain virtually invulnerable. He tries to stop sound stalkers in every possible way, intends to destroy anyone who comes close to solving the mysteries of the musical universe.\n\nThe Queen of Smorings is the leader of the rebel movement and the guardian of friendly people who have been under the yoke of invaders for many years. Empathic, sensitive, at the same time imperious, unshakable and wise in decisions. She lives in a valley on one of the stars of the Alpha Centauri system, has high extrasensory sensitivity."

The main characters hunt for rare artifacts in different dimensions and star systems. One of the trips presents an unpleasant surprise and their space gadget is sucked into a black hole. From now on, nothing goes according to their plan and things take an unexpected turn..."
