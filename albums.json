    "description": "spclnch presents the first release from Australian producer and DJ Kooscha called «Reflections».\nEveryone is inclined to see their own reflections in the world. After all, they are a logical continuation of us. Carefully, leisurely, calmly and harmoniously, sometimes hypnotizing, the author moves us from composition to composition, then picking up the pace, then slowing down, leaving a pleasant aftertaste. Enjoy listening!",

    "description": "Wait stranger, take a look around.\nHave you ever noticed how many things are happening around, that everything has its own rhythm, its sense of time and space. And all about that is interconnected. Time... It's what points the way, making you different from whom you were a moment ago. It is worth remembering, it flows in only one direction, and therefore causes such a strong interest.\nLet the rhythm of time pass through you and give it free rein. And then it becomes clear that the present moment is something elusive. This is the moment when emotions, events and space merge together, when you catch yourself of thinking that the moment you are living is eternal. But only here and only now.\nIf you could choose which moment to pause and make it last forever, which one it would be?\n\nIn the compilation, the theme of time was used as a foundation. Each participant revealed it in its own way, original and unique. Each of them knows exactly how to stop time and grasp the moment of eternity. Pleasant journey.\n\nContinuation can be found on hello▼strange:\nhellostrange.bandcamp.com/album/time",

    "description": "Three dub Musketeers, nobly animating the ubiquitous flow of reverberations, skillfully fence with micro-textures. Desolated melancholy and dotted rhythm emphasize the formlessness of ambient structures, causing emotional restraint.\nThe limited edition record by Vincent Raude (Upwellings), a French cultivator of deep-sea dub techno streams, comes from the bowels of analog synthesizers. Its sound makes sense and steadily penetrates into the auditory range, expressing the interactive-spatial evolution of music.\nPeter Fanai (Basicnoise), a lover of subtle dubby jams, producing from late 90s and consistent, methodical electronic pedant from Sydney Kyryl Polozyuk (Kooscha) made a vinyl contribution.\n\n«Once you have chosen your path, you will become it. The once perplexing vicissitudes of fate will be taken as a starting point. We are here and continue to see incredible in the usual!»",

Nobody will ask us do we need that right now or not - the injection of nostalgia takes the effect of tranquilizer in order to let us see the world in which we had been living some time ago.\n\nFairy tales from past remind us about the events that were happening so long time ago. Later, even not the most pleasant memories somehow are wrapped in serene foil forming the integrated whole in the lifestream.",

The flow of sound, though not always obvious, manipulations creates a sense of dynamic balance.\nThe incomprehensibly abstract environment, saturated with biology and meaning of digital structures, finds its culmination in a Remix from the master of uncompromising grooves — Basicnoise! His boundless space Odysseys are echoed by a deep bass that abolishes ephemeral musical constructions.",

They departed too far from their intended trajectory and made a forced hard landing. A critical dose of meteor fragments damaged one of the engines. It was necessary to fix the damage as soon as possible or to get an alternative type of fuel.\n\nAfter looking around them, the space travelers began to move towards the mysterious craters almost by feel. Suddenly, the ground got out from under their feet. Due to poor visibility, the rush led to an expectable outcome. \"Great, we're trapped!\", - Cat looked at his companion from under his brows, insistently hinting at a clear explanation of what was happening.\n\n– This is a Planet of Mineralization's Dubs, my friend.\n– Hm...\n– Its interior consists of metamorphic deposits formed by layers of two types of fossils: igneous and sedimentary.\n– Mineralization's Dubs?!\n– I don't know, what's bothering you?\n– At least the fact that we are waist-deep in a swamp with an incomprehensible viscous substance!\n– We'll get out, don't doubt it. There are still many mysteries to solve in the Universe. Just focus on these sound waves, can you hear them?",

By the way, it helps to recover after critical overloads through fine motor skills.\n\nWelcome to the heavenly body \\\"Orlan 19\\\". Once it was assigned an ordinal number, and it got this name because of its ultra-low gravity. Obviously, this \\\"dwarf\\\" became an attraction and just a recreational area for many nomads. Its atmosphere is literally packed with thoughtfully hovering objects of various configurations. A kind of metaphysical equilibrium. Here it is customary to not only enjoy the abundance of entertainment, but also the thoughts about where the consciousness leads us in search of its home.\n\nDeftly juggling patterns, the technologist grabbed an experimental sample labeled RTW1350, which, thanks to its composition and consistency, easily gives the appearance of a basketball.\nCatch - the next throw is yours!",

But what will they become: a collection of fears and questions or the embodiment of a real experience? The cabin shook, the sensors screeched in unison, announcing extreme overload, a bright flash! Emptiness. What is it: strange whispers, snatches of sounds, noises, echoes of the frightening unknown rang in my ears.\n\nIt soon turned out that riding the waves of atomic-molecular flow is not so scary. Quantum teleportation is quite a common process for those who have fallen into the cold embrace of a black hole. Random formulas, geometric progressions, and a detailed model of the universe pop up in your mind as if at someone's command. Suddenly, a strange silhouette flashed past - perhaps a clot of dark matter, or perhaps someone got caught in an endless cycle and rushed with great speed into a parallel dimension. The main thing is not to break into particles from such a swirl and strong rotation.\n\nThe intergalactic tornado calmed down and the image stabilized. Just think, until recently Cat could not imagine such a story. His eyes widened in surprise. Looking at each other, the friends realized that everything had happened for a reason, they were being watched...",

    "description": "After a decent corpuscular thrashing, the calibration of the control systems went in normal mode.\nWhen the readings of the instrument were analysed, there was an enthusiastic voice on board: \"Thermoregulation is normal, cap! Electromagnetic induction and differential change of the phase integral are calculated! Full speed ahead!\"\n\nAfter passing through the dense asteroid belt, the broken testers found that a kinetic teleport spat out their aircraft near the orbital station \"Research Institute of Cybernetics\", where an unscheduled study of the dynamic modulations and illumination of the moon was carried out using ultrasonic transducers.\n\nWith amazing ease, they ended up in the center of scientific research, in the middle of a landfill filled with splitting blasters and life-size holographic models. The mechanics of this action had an absolutely mesmerizing effect, making anyone who witnessed it freeze in amazement. The slow-motion fashion show of the prototypes reflected the metamorphoses of the growing (as they say among Earthlings), full and waning moon, reminding us of the grandiosity of the internal changes of each of us and of the magnetic integrity they possess.",

    "description": "A beam of intense light drew the professor's attention to the hypno-spiral, which had become his first goal in studying astronomical objects of the \"Quasar\" class. However, everyone has their own desires. Cat, for example, tried to comprehend passionarity and look at the reflection of what was happening. The genre scenes that unfolded before the eyes of the experimenters went beyond the 3d dimension. Bubble pattern, cold draft, rusted house, wet format – they seemed to be on the verge of insanity.\n\nAlthough in the past the Spacelunch studied at the Department of Experimental Phonetics and Speech Synthesis, the adaptation of consciousness was still difficult. The answers to the inner questions turned into a swarm of sound isotopes. Space was shifting, going deep, rotating and stretching in all possible directions, reducing all efforts to concentrate almost to zero. No wonder, because music is not just a technical object, but an ideological principle. The delta dimension, which is full of spectral lines, is clearly not the place for a logical routine with complex calculations - the auditory stream expresses something more, just trust the sensations.",

    "description": "Having won approval and success in its debut release, the spclnch vinyl series continues with the release of a second record from Wiesbaden producer – Peter Fanai.\nWeighty, spacious bass pleiades fill the sound field, erase the consequences of duality and, flowing into the viscous full-bodied substance of verified sound design, it would seem that they will momentarily shift the tectonic plates of the electronic genre.\nMaestro Basicnoise is again involved in the spatial enrichment of textural proportions of reverberation and percussion. This time, their sequence runs under the quality mark of the Australian-German collaboration. The accurate Kooscha warms up the sensorics with elegant dance manipulations and a distinct rhythm, and the related association Echoton traditionally introduces a tart concentrate of meaningful thoughts.\nThe rich aftertaste of variable electronic abstractions takes the subconscious and musical outlook to a different plane.\nNow you are more than an observer.",

    "description": "They didn't come here for nothing. Spacelunch was promising the merge with energy-informational thinking substances at the level of elementary particles. The crystal sound spread like ectoplasm along the walls of the reflecting vessel of the universe. Drama and the eager grin of adventure have slowed down, bowing its heads in submission to the convergence of musical exuberance. Meditation on the event horizon lit the torch of sharpened perception of all the amplitude shifts.\n\nDubby substrate absorbed every scrap of the all-pervading ether. This meant that the indefatigable pioneers had harnessed the elements, becoming the bearers of important, extracted knowledge. From now on, their bioresonators are as precisely tuned as possible to the condensation of acoustic waves, which, like a compass, will point the way to the probabilities that emit a powerful impulse. Space stalking and audio transcription are being taken to the new dimensions.",

The encounter with the minimal antagonist, who was following the irreconcilable ufologists during the quantum leap, was so unexpected that they barely realized how they switched bodies.\n\nThe endless maze of stairs and abandoned, winding corridors of the aerospace corporation was confusing due to spatial reversion. The cuttlefish's minions, the shadow phantoms, followed them step by step like its ubiquitous giant tentacles, crawling underfoot and along the walls.\n\nCat 007 fastidiously refused to put up with the role of prisoners and, grabbing his friend, blasting well-aimed, cutting shots from the service blaster, left a couple of decent holes in the energy field of annoying creatures. Without a doubt, it became obvious that interplanetary explorers were being hunted.",

    "description": "After passing through the sights of the clouds of galactic dust, the patrol cruiser brought the brave, hard-to-get-out-of-trouble friends to the Andromeda Nebula. An astrophysical textbook with the basics of meta-cognitive therapy is of a great help in planning new searches in the depths of the celestial web, reboot and dream circulation.\n\nCat performs a ritual of debugging vibration fields with the help of immersive mantras. Their light, airy reflections have long been used to eliminate nonverbal attacks on consciousness. The multidimensional immersion in the cradle of sound sensorics becomes tangible.",

    "description": "Unearthing the ruins of a vanished Martian civilization has led to a portal to an apocalyptic, aggressive world, where the echoes of race battles thundered, flames blazed everywhere and demonic priests pestered. The previous research team left behind only SOS signals, frightening with their helplessness and encrypted on the flight recorder as a warning to all outsiders about the inadmissibility of staying here.\n\nThe audio messages contain information about strange pataphysical phenomena, suspicious accidents, and a mass obsession of the expedition members. Rare specimens of the fauna of the infernal dimension, collected at the cost of many human lives, pointed to the main mystery – a sarcophagus with ancient writings sealed with an occult pentagram. The die is cast, what remains is being patient and count on luck.",
